**Welcome to 21st century marketing and communications from service professionals.**

Your agent, **Paul Doney,** has a background in national film and television production that helps him craft the perfect presentation for your home. His passion for the Wellington region and everything it has to offer is infectious. He will tell buyers the story they need to hear to understand the ultimate value of their purchase. Combine this with the grace and charm of his wife **Sabine**, who hails from a 5 star hotel management and marketing background and you have a team that will present your property with style.

Selling a home is an emotional decision that Paul understands. But you're not the only one making big changes -- so is the future owner of your home. Let Paul put his knowledge of what motivates buyers to work for you and get you the best price.

That's the price you deserve and the one that will propel you forward in to a fabulous future.

Tall Poppy is all about doing things differently, doing them better.

Let Paul exceed your expectations and leave you delighted and surprised by how great the adventure of selling a home can be.
