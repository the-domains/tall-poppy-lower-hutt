What Do We Mean By "UNBEATABLE FLAT FEE"?

Just that - unbeatable. There's no other FULL-SERVICE real estate agency in New Zealand that will sell the average house for $10,000 + GST, let alone a more expensive house. All houses, every house - the fee will not be more than $10,000 + GST.

If you have a lower priced property where this would be more than the fee charged by other agencies, we will beat the other agency's fee. If you have a written quote from another agency wher

e they have been keen to discount, we will still beat their fee.

We won't be beaten on fees OR service.  
Providing you with exemplary service and achieving the best possible sale price is more important to Tall Poppy.
