**Help us make large cash donations to your school.**

Paul Doney, of Tall Poppy Real Estate, is offering to donate $500 to a school you nominate. That's $100 if you refer someone thinking of selling their house for a FREE appraisal, and they sign up to sell with him. And when their house sells he will donate a further $400 to the same school. Don't worry, if you're not associated with a school you can always nominate a charity.

This offer is good till the end of 2016\.

Imagine how many houses might sell from your school area and it's contacts this year, and how much money that could mean for children's education! Just 4 houses in a year would mean $2,000 for school sports equipment, a new computer, etc. How many cake stalls does it take to raise that kind of extra money for your school?
