**Who REALLY Wants to Buy Your House?**  

**Tall Poppy**does things differently. It's not just the unbeatable, flat fee.

Tall Poppy agents think differently. In particular, they're not stuck in a business model that was created in a pre-internet era when people HAD to look in a paper or magazine to find what was for sale. They HAD to walk around shopping centers looking in the windows of agents to see a SINGLE colour photograph of properties for sale. In those days agents sold you that access to a simpler, slow moving market. It took weeks and weeks to be sure you had reached a reasonable number of people who would potentially buy your property.

Not today.

Today, most people when they buy a property have been actively using TradeMe on a daily basis. They have been looking for months and have become EXPERTS in a particular narrow segment of the local market. They know that segment better than the agent. They know exactly what in a property has value for them (and it's often things an agent wouldn't think of or value the same way). If it's a tight or fast moving market they have also become a bit desperate. They've kissed so many frogs, they know a Prince when they see one. They are probably still regretting not buying the first property they looked at because they haven't seen anything as good since, but they weren't ready when they first started looking. At the time they couldn't be sure there wasn't something better out there.

Most properties only need a week on the market because the small number of people who would ACTUALLY buy are desperately waiting for just the right house to appear and when it does they will leap on it. Most are capable of making a decision quickly if they have enough information (hence the value of supplying LIMs and building reports up front). That first week is crucial and after that the demand will fall away precipitously.

Don't let expensive, antiquated sales methods like auction and tender with 3 to 4 week programs let your potential buyers slip away. Ask a Tall poppy agent about Bid to Buy and the many ways they can save you money, stress and heartache.
